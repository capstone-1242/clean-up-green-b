        <h2>INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS</h2>
        <p>Oil spills are an inevitable part of the industrial sector. Left unchecked, these spills quickly become time-consuming and costly to clean. Furthermore, the ramifications of the environmental damage caused by a spill can cause unwanted attention and can lead to expensive government fines.</p>
        <p>Most remediation options involve a combination of extensive and invasive excavation or an application of a chemical solution that is harmful to the user and the environment. Both methods result in excessive costs, and both require spill clean-up waste to be hauled away and disposed of at waste treatment facilities.</p>
        <p>Clean-Up Green oil solutions technology is the safe effective way of permanently cleaning all types of spills. Clean-Up Green will save you time and expensive clean-up costs.</p>

                <h3>TRADITIONAL REMEDIATION</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using absorbent powders, mats, acids, and chemicals.</li>
                    <li>Sorbent Materials: Only soaks up the mess but does not encapsulate the hydrocarbons.</li>
                    <li>Not Safe For Landfill Disposal: Most waste is toxic and must still be disposed of using a Hydrovac and cleaning facility.</li>
                    <li>Expensive Disposal Costs: Must be disposed of in an approved remediation facility. Costs up to $800 per 55 gal drum.</li>
                    <li>Costs Time: Cleanup time, including arranging transport to a remediation facility is time-consuming.</li>

            <h3>QUICK TIPS:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Less product is required than other absorbent products. Powder does not absorb water.</li>
                <li>For a large spill, use the powder to make a berm first to contain the spill and keep it localized in one area. Then proceed to spread powder to the inside of the spill.</li>
