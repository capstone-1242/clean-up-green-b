                    <p><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> Do not pre-mix STEP 1 & STEP 2 together in advance. Apply individually one at a time to the stain or spill.</p>

                    <h3>Application:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Have the entire stain come into contact with STEP 1. To apply, pour or spray on a solid surface and rub in with a hard bristle brush or broom. For spills in soil or sand, use a rake or shovel to aggregate the entire area to make contact with STEP 1.</li>
                        <li>Apply STEP 2 in the same manner and rub in using the hard bristle brush or broom. Use a 1 to 1 ratio of both steps. You will notice the liquids harden up and form a grey paste-like mixture once they have been brought into contact with each other on the stain. Odours are eliminated on contact.</li>
                        <li>For best results let the mixture dry into a powder before cleaning up. Stains are lifted once dry. 24 hrs drying time is ideal for most applications.</li>
                        <li>The dry silica powder (sand) is non-hazardous and non-toxic. It can be left on the spill site or swept away and discarded. Repeat process steps if both odour or stain remains - particularly with older more embedded stains.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Once dry a white haze may remain on surface where you have applied the liquids which will disappear over time. For pooling oil spills use Clean-Up Green OS Powder.</p>

                    <h3>Application:</h3>
                    <p>Spread powder over a spill on water or a hard surface until excess white polymer remains on the surface. Apply by hand or use a hand spreader, blower, or other conventional methods for spreading out the powder. You will notice the powder starts to work upon contact.</p>

                    <h3>Quick Tip:</h3>
                    <p>Any excess white powder that remains is reusable as it does not absorb any of the hydrocarbons. Simply brush it to the side and return any unused powder to the bag.</p>

                    <h3>Removal:</h3>
                    <p>The longer the wait time, the greater the absorption and the more solid the polymer will become. The product may be picked up as a rubber-like mat for easy disposal. Excess white powder can be reused. Hydrocarbons and synthetic oils require more time before removal and will form into a softer cluster. In most cases, removal may begin in as few as 5 minutes. For stained surfaces or where the spill has been absorbed into soil or hard surfaces, apply Clean-Up Green Oil Stain Liquid to complete the clean-up process.</p>
